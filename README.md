Example project to create a Python Extension package in C using the Cython.Build library.

This program runs the fibonacci sequence to (32) using Python and Cython Implementations,
and performs a speed test on the computational time to completion.

Everything in this project has been automated, although 'chmod' permissions and other script
settings were not functioning properly within Ubuntu using WSL2. Therefore, some bash commands
have been replaced with printed console directives to follow for this example/core project.

You are free to use this project/source code for your own personal projects. This is only
a simple core template, but it will get you started with developing Python code optimizations.

To begin, run in the root of the project:

'sh ./run_me_first.sh'
